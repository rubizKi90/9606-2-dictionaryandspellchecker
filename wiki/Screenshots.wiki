The second interface shows the result after clicking the 'Search' button. The Result field shows if the user has correctly spelled the word. Then the Definition field will provide the correct meaning of the entered word. 

We used the word "dictionary" for the testing of the program. Thanks to our programmer, it worked! The program verified that the word is correctly spelled and it gave the definition of the chosen word.

The third interface shows the result of the user after clicking the 'Search' button but the inputted word was spelled incorrectly. The result field will show the user that the word in incorrectly spelled and it will show other suggestions of the word the user wants to know. 

We used the word "pulchrade" to test the correctness of the program. And it worked! The program showed that the word inputted is incorrectly spelled and it provided some close words (which are correctly spelled) as suggestions.
